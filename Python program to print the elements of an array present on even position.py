'''
In this program, we need to print the element which is present on even position. Even positioned element can 
be found by traversing the array and incrementing the value of i by 2.
'''
arr = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70]
print("Elements present on even positions:")
for i in range(0,len(arr),2):
	print(arr[i])
