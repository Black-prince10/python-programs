Quadratic equation:
Quadratic equation is made from a Latin term "quadrates" which means square. It is a special 
type of equation having the form of:
axÂ²+bx+c=0
Here, "x" is unknown which you have to find and "a", "b", "c" specifies the numbers such that
"a" is not equal to 0. If a = 0 then the equation becomes liner not quadratic anymore.
In the equation, a, b and c are called coefficients.
